AI Usage Declaration

I used ChatGPT to help me:
- Understand the assignment instructions more clearly.
- Get suggestions for proper HTML/CSS structure and naming conventions (BEM style).
- Review my existing code and identify improvements.

All the final HTML and CSS code was written, structured, and tested by me. 
I did not use AI to auto-generate the full assignment solution; instead, I used it only for guidance and best practices. 
The coding, debugging, and deployment work was done manually by me.

This declaration is provided honestly in accordance with the instructions of the assignment.
